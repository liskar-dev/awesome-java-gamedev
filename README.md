This is an opinionated collection of resources, libraries, framweworks that are worth considering for graphics/game/engine development in Java

## Tutorials

- [3D Game Development with LWJGL 3](https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/)
- [Vulkan graphics programming in Java](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/vulkanbook/tree/master/bookcontents)

## Frameworks

- [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) - JNI bindings for native APIs and libraries. Notably:
  - Assimp - library to import and export various 3d-model-formats including scene-post-processing to generate missing render data
  - OpenGL - cross-language, cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics
  - Vulkan - next generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs
  - [and many many more](https://www.lwjgl.org/customize)
- [JMonkey](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) - a modern developer friendly game engine written primarily in Java
- [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) - game development framework based on OpenGL ES that works on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, your browser and iOS
- [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) - JavaFX Game Development Framework

### Libraries

- [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) - Java OpenGL Math Library
- [fastutil](https://github.com/vigna/fastutil) - type-specific maps, sets, lists and queues with a small memory footprint
- [Kyro](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) - Java binary serialization and cloning: fast, efficient, automatic 
- [KryoNet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet) - TCP/UDP client/server library for Java, based on Kryo  
- [Netty](https://netty.io/) - an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
- [KryoNetty](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonetty) - library that provides clean and simple API for efficient TCP client/server network communication using Netty
- [Dominion ECS](https://www.dominion.dev/) - Insanely fast Entity Component System library for Java
- [physix-jni](https://github.com/fabmax/physx-jni) - PhysX 4 JNI bindings for Java
- [mujoco-java](https://github.com/CommonWealthRobotics/mujoco-java) - Java JNI binding for mujoco physics system
- [steamworks4j](https://github.com/code-disaster/steamworks4j) - thin wrapper which allows Java applications to access the Steamworks C++ API
